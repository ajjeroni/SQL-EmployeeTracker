# SQL-EmployeeTracker

## Description

For this task, students had to develop a node.js application that involved npm's such as inquierer and mysql2. This application connected to a mysql database to view, add, and update tables that stored departments, roles, and employee data, through the use of inquierer in the command-line. 

This task was really amusing and straightforward, having had experience with inquierer already, using mysql was the part that was difficult especially when trying to use queries. 

## Usage

run npm i

run node index.js

use arrow keys to chose options from inquier
